- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cindy Chen, a graduate student at Columbia studying applied statistics and data science in the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences program.
I have a background in business analytics and management consulting (:hammer: my primary tools were VBA, Excel, Alteryx, Anaplan, SAP BI, and R).  I decided to go back to school to enhance my understand of statistics, quant research methodology, and programming in Python, PySpark, SQL, and R.
