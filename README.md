#### Hi, I’m Cindy <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="10px">

- I'm a graduate student at Columbia studying applied statistics and data science in the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences program.  I'm a creative problem-solver who really likes the challenge of making sense of data.

#### How I got here

- 🕰️ I have a background in business analytics and retail industry-based management consulting, and have long been involved in initiatives around women's advancement and empowerment.  I studied business and multidisciplinary liberal arts (essentially a little bit of everything like physics, econ, French, linear algebra, and the political economy of media)
> :hammer: My primary tools in my past roles were VBA, Excel, Alteryx, Anaplan, SAP BI, and R)

#### Where I'm heading
- I decided to go back to school to enhance my understand of statistics, quant research methodology, and programming in Python, PySpark, SQL, and R.
- 👀 I'm currently looking for summer internship opportunities to apply my programming and statistical learning; I'm particularly interested in roles in business (especially retail), regulation, and research. Long-term, I'd love to leverage data science in a social good / fairness-related manner.
