#### Hi, I’m Cindy 

- I'm a recent applied statistics and data science graduate from the Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences Masters program at Columbia University.  I'm a creative problem-solver who really likes the challenge of making sense of data.

#### How I got here

- 🕰️ I have a background in business analytics and retail industry-based management consulting, and have long been involved in initiatives around women's advancement and empowerment.  I studied business and multidisciplinary liberal arts (essentially a little bit of everything like physics, econ, French, linear algebra, and the political economy of media)

> :hammer: Python, R (including building Shiny apps), PySpark, Databricks, Tableau, VBA, Alteryx, Excel

#### Where I'm heading
- 👀 I'm currently seeking full-time opportunities to apply my quantitative skills; I'm particularly interested in roles in business (especially retail) and regulation (especially around fairness). Long-term, I'd love to leverage data science for algorithmic accountability.

#### Where to find me:
