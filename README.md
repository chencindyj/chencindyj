- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cindy Chen, a Master's student in Columbia University's Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences program.
I have a background in business analytics and management consulting, where I primarily used Excel and VBA.  I decided to go back to school to enhance my command of applied statistics, machine learning, and programming in Python, SQL, and R.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the topic of algorithmic fairness and accountability, especially as it relates to machine learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning (very familiar with SciKit-Learn) and deep learning (using keras) in both Python and R.  I'm also an on-campus Research Assistant assisting with a NLP and machine learning project.
