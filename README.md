- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cindy Chen, a Master's student at Columbia University studying applied statistics and data science.
I have a background in business analytics and management consulting, where I primarily used Excel and VBA.  I decided to go back to school to enhance my command of statistics and coding in Python, PySpark, SQL, and R.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the topic of algorithmic fairness and accountability, especially as it relates to machine learning.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me on Twitter @cindy__chen or LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/chencindyj)
