#### Hi, I’m Cindy 

- I'm a Data Scientist. I'm a creative problem-solver who thoroughly enjoys making sense of data and has the experience to prove it.

#### How I got here

- 🕰️ I have a background in business analytics, management consulting, and data science.  My educational background spans interdisciplinary liberal arts, business, and quantitative social sciences.  I like learning Bayesian statistics (my culminating thesis used Bayesian methods and you can find the project in my Github), applying my learning, and remaining skeptical of AI snake oil.

> :hammer: Python, R (including building Shiny apps), SQL (SQL Server, PostgreSQL), Spark, Databricks, Tableau, VBA, Alteryx, Excel (including VBA)
